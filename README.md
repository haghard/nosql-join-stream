Nosql-join-stream
===================

Goals:
  * Demonstrate power of design based on "Abstract algebraic data type"
  * Provide support for 2 streaming libs: [ScalazStream](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream) and [RxScala](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala.git)

The main idea for Abstract algebraic data type design was taken from this [blog post](http://io.pellucid.com/blog/abstract-algebraic-data-type)
